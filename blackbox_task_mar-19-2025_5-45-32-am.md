The task is to build an AI Chatbot focusing on tourism in Sarawak, with specific emphasis on six tourism clusters: Homestays, Food & Beverages, Fashion, Traditional Crafts, Heritage Attractions, and Performing Arts. 

Since there are no visible files in the current working directory, I will need to create a new project structure for the chatbot. This will likely involve creating a main file for the chatbot logic, as well as any necessary configuration files.

Next, I will outline the plan for building the chatbot, including the necessary components and structure.

**Assistant:**

I have successfully created the AI Chatbot for tourism in Sarawak. The chatbot includes six tourism clusters: Homestays, Food & Beverages, Fashion, Traditional Crafts, Heritage Attractions, and Performing Arts. 

### Summary of the Chatbot:
- The chatbot provides recommendations based on user inquiries about the specified tourism clusters.
- It includes a simple command-line interface for interaction.
- Users can ask about different clusters or exit the chat.

Next, I will run the chatbot to ensure it functions correctly. 

<execute_command>
<command>python3 sarawak_tourism_chatbot.py</command>
</execute_command>
